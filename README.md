## 📁 Data Storage Information

### Current Implementation: Browser localStorage

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a front-end only solution**

The current dashboard stores ALL data in your **browser's localStorage**. Here's what this means:

#### ✅ Advantages:
- **No server required** - Works instantly, no hosting needed
- **Completely free** - No database costs
- **Fast performance** - Instant data access
- **Private** - Data never leaves your device
- **Offline capable** - Works without internet

#### ⚠️ Limitations:
- **Device-specific** - Data only accessible on the device where it was created
- **Browser-specific** - Different browsers = different data
- **Temporary** - Clearing browser data/cache will DELETE all records
- **No sync** - Cannot access from multiple devices
- **Storage limit** - Typically 5-10MB (sufficient for most small businesses)
- **No backup** - Unless manually exported

#### 🔄 What Happens to Your Data:
- ✅ Saves automatically when you enter it
- ✅ Persists when you close and reopen the browser
- ✅ Available next time you visit the page (same device/browser)
- ❌ **LOST** if you:
  - Clear browser history/cache/cookies
  - Uninstall the browser
  - Use browser's "Reset" or "Clear data" feature
  - Access from a different device
  - Use a different browser on same device
  - Use incognito/private browsing mode

## 📞 Questions?

Common Questions:

**Q: Will my data be safe?**  
A: Only as safe as your device. Use the backup feature and upgrade to a database for better security.

**Q: Can I access from my phone?**  
A: Yes, dashboard is responsive, but data won't sync (different device = different data).

**Q: How much data can I store?**  
A: localStorage typically allows 5-10MB. That's approximately:
- 5,000-10,000 transactions
- 500-1,000 customers
- 100-200 vehicles

**Q: What if I clear my browser cache by mistake?**  
A: All data is LOST unless you have a backup. This is why we strongly recommend upgrading to a database.

**Q: Can multiple people use this?**  
A: Not simultaneously with current setup. Each device has its own data. Need database for multi-user.
