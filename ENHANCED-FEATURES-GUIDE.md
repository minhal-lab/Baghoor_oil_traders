## 🎨 HOW IT WORKS

### 1️⃣ Setting Up Customer/Supplier Rates

When you add a customer or supplier, you specify **TWO rates**:
- **Petrol Rate** (e.g., Rs. 253 per liter)
- **HSD Rate** (e.g., Rs. 245 per liter)

**Example:**
```
Customer: Ahmed Traders
Petrol Rate: Rs. 253
HSD Rate: Rs. 245
```

These rates are **automatically applied** when you create a transaction with this party!

## 🔢 CALCULATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Simple Sale (No Discount)
```
Customer: Ahmed Traders
Product: Petrol
Customer's Rate: Rs. 253/L
Quantity: 1000 L
Discount: 0

Calculation:
Final Rate = 253 - 0 = Rs. 253
Total = 1000 × 253 = Rs. 253,000
```

### Example 2: Sale with Discount
```
Customer: City Fuel Station
Product: HSD
Customer's Rate: Rs. 244/L
Quantity: 2000 L
Discount: 4 Rs/L

Calculation:
Final Rate = 244 - 4 = Rs. 240
Total = 2000 × 240 = Rs. 480,000

Discount Given = 2000 × 4 = Rs. 8,000
```

### Example 3: Profit Calculation
```
Purchase:
Supplier: PSO
Product: Petrol
Purchase Rate: Rs. 250/L
Quantity: 5000 L
Total Cost: Rs. 1,250,000

Sale:
Customer: Bismillah
Sale Rate: Rs. 255/L
Discount: 2 Rs/L
Final Rate: 253 Rs/L
Quantity: 5000 L
Total Revenue: Rs. 1,265,000

Profit Calculation:

Profit per Liter = 253 - 250 = Rs. 3/L
(Note: 2 Rs discount reduced profit from 5 to 3 Rs/L)
